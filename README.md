# ICS-Grade-11

I took this course because I want to have a career in computer science. Not only that, but it is actually very interesting to me, and it seems like computer science would be a very helpful tool to use in my daily life. Out of this class, I hope to get useufl computer science skills that I can use it to automate things, create things that I need that haven't been created before, and help others make things they want to make with the help of my computer science skills and abilities.

Some creative features that are memorable to me are, first, the ability to save and load a game file (like the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild), and second, this one is a bit more obscure, but I like it when a video game thinks outside the box. Some examples include Undertale and Windowkill.
